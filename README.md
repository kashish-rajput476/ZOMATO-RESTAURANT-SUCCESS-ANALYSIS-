# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis using Zomato Dataset 📊

## 📌 Introduction
The food and restaurant industry is rapidly evolving, with data playing a crucial role in understanding customer preferences, restaurant performance, and market trends. In this project, we analyze the Zomato dataset to extract valuable insights about restaurants, cuisines, pricing, and customer ratings.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📍 Understand the distribution of restaurants across different cities
- ⭐ Analyze customer ratings and their correlation with price
- 🍜 Identify the most popular cuisines and restaurant types
- 💰 Examine cost variations across locations

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Zomato dataset**, which includes details such as:
- 🏠 Restaurant name and location
- 💵 Average cost for two people
- 🍽️ Cuisines served
- ⭐ User ratings and votes
- 🛵 Delivery and dining options

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and fill/remove missing values
2. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize restaurant names, remove duplicates
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new variables for better analysis (e.g., price categories, rating groups)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We use **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to perform EDA:

### 1️⃣ Distribution of Restaurants by City
- 🌍 Identify cities with the most restaurants using bar charts
- 🔍 Compare the presence of global vs. local restaurant chains

### 2️⃣ Restaurant Ratings Analysis
- 📈 Distribution of ratings using histograms
- 🔗 Correlation between ratings and price
- 🏆 Identify top-rated restaurants

### 3️⃣ Popular Cuisines
- 🍕 Find the most common cuisines
- 🌆 Compare cuisines' popularity across different cities

### 4️⃣ Cost Analysis
- 📊 Box plots to visualize cost variations
- 📍 Compare price range by city and restaurant type

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 🏁 Conclusion
This analysis provides key insights into the restaurant industry, helping businesses make data-driven decisions on pricing, menu offerings, and location strategies. Future enhancements include integrating real-time data, customer review analysis, and recommendation systems.
