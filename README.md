# ZOMATO-RESTAURANT-SUCCESS-ANALYSIS-
Restaurant Data Analysis using Zomato Dataset

Introduction

The food and restaurant industry is rapidly evolving, with data playing a crucial role in understanding customer preferences, restaurant performance, and market trends. In this project, we analyze the Zomato dataset to extract valuable insights about restaurants, cuisines, pricing, and customer ratings.

Objectives

Understand the distribution of restaurants across different cities

Analyze customer ratings and their correlation with price

Identify the most popular cuisines and restaurant types

Examine cost variations across locations

Dataset

We use the Zomato dataset, which includes details such as:

Restaurant name and location

Average cost for two people

Cuisines served

User ratings and votes

Delivery and dining options

Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Identify and fill/remove missing values

Data Cleaning: Standardize restaurant names, remove duplicates

Feature Engineering: Create new variables for better analysis (e.g., price categories, rating groups)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform EDA:

1. Distribution of Restaurants by City

Identify cities with the most restaurants using bar charts

Compare the presence of global vs. local restaurant chains

2. Restaurant Ratings Analysis

Distribution of ratings using histograms

Correlation between ratings and price

Identify top-rated restaurants

3. Popular Cuisines

Find the most common cuisines

Compare cuisines' popularity across different cities

4. Cost Analysis

Box plots to visualize cost variations

Compare price range by city and restaurant type

Tools & Technologies Used

Conclusion

This analysis provides key insights into the restaurant industry, helping businesses make data-driven decisions on pricing, menu offerings, and location strategies. Future enhancements include integrating real-time data, customer review analysis, and recommendation systems.
